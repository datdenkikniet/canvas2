        <h2> What is the browser action? </h2>
        <p> The browser action allows the user to click on the Dark Mode for Canvas extension icon in their web browser's toolbar and cause a popup to display. </p>
        <p>This popup is used to provide information to the user, such as what version of the extension they are running, plus a list of options to change theme settings or report and issue they are having with the extension. </p>
        <p> When developing new aspects of the browser action, please follow the standard formatting available in /browser-action/popup.css and /browser-action/popup.html. If you have ideas for new styling of popup options, feel free to make those changes and make suggestions for better UI design </p>
